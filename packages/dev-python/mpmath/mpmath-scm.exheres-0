SUMMARY="Pure-Python library for multiprecision floating-point arithmetic"
DESCRIPTION="
Mpmath is a pure-Python library for multiprecision floating-point arithmetic. It provides an
extensive set of transcendental functions, unlimited exponent sizes, complex numbers, interval
arithmetic, numerical integration and differentiation, root-finding, linear algebra, and much more.
Almost any calculation can be performed just as well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision, and in
many cases mpmath implements asymptotically fast algorithms that scale well for extremely high
precision work. Mpmath internally uses Python's builtin long integers by default, but automatically
switches to GMP/MPIR for much faster high-precision arithmetic if gmpy is installed or if mpmath is
imported from within Sage.
